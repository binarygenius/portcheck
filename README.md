# portcheck

Portcheck is a simple and small script for FreeBSD that first updates the ports tree and then runs an  update and a security checkup of all the installed packages.

Portcheck depends on portsnap, portaudit and pkg_version.

This script is old so you need to verify that it works with the current FreeBSD version and that it is relevant for usage (something never and better might exist).
